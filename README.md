# Rutgers-challenge-3-Password-Generator


## Description

This is a random password generator for the 3rd challange. My motivation is to solidify my understanding of Javascript. As well as become more comfortable writing functional code. 
I wrote the code the way I did all layered because my thought was that one large casading function would allow a single button click to prompt user input, and then spit out a randomized password.     
The problem that a Random Password Generator solves is added security for the user. If they have access to a random string of numbers letters (captilized and lower case) and special characters than they can feel more secure knowing that it will be more difficult for unwanted persons to access the users private information.
I learned that I have misunderstood how cascading works in Javascript. I thought that you could take a function and stuff it full of variables and more functions and for statements. I still think that to be true so I think there must be some syntax or formating that throwing everything off. Maybe its not linking to the index correctly or I'm not calling my button prompts correctly. I'll figure out eventually.
